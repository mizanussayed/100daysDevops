# Day 30: Git hard reset

##  task:
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:

1. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.

2. Also make sure to push your changes.

## Solution:
1. First, navigate to the git repository:
```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
```
2. Use the `git log` command to find the commit hash of the commit with the message "add data.txt file":
```bash
git log --oneline
```
3. Once you have the commit hash, use the `git reset` command to reset the
HEAD and the branch to that commit:
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```
4. Finally, push the changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name> --force
```
